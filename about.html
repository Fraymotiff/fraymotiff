    <p class="abtxt" > About Lua Jaxuka</p>
    
<br><br>
    <p class="desc">
    I'm Lua Jaxuka, also known as <i><b> Fraymotiff</b></i>. I am a Brasilian indigenous freelance illustrator and Youtuber located on capital area of Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil.
<br><br>
    Games, Japanese pop culture and nature are my biggest inspirations and that My work is influenced by both a lot of pop culture and my own ancestral roots, and as the years progress that becomes even more evident.
     I like to explore with a lot of mediums, not limitating myself to a singular type of artistry. I am very aware and curious about the directions that I can take with my work.
     My style also changes a good amount, depending on the medium i am working with, I am capable of doing both cartooon and realism (although having realism as style of preference).
     I am very invested in character design and storybuilding, and have been working on my own comic for quite some time in 2022.
<br><br>
     I have worked in many private commissions and have sold my character designs previously and it is something that I have great passion for!
I also am an avid cosplayer and propmaker, having worked in the field of propmaking for 2 years in my teenage years.
     I am a  bachelor graduate on the  Visual Arts College on UFRGS (Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul), and as of now, (march 2023) am 3  semesters away from graduating and working on my BFA.
       I have always had an inclinations for video making, i love editing and recording, especially my process.
